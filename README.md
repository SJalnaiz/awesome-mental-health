# Awesome Mental Health

## What is this?
A collection of resources to help understand and improve mental wellbeing.

## Goal
More than a guide, a community sourced and curated resource for achieving proper mental wellbeing in any situation. Whether a pandemic, a personal challenge, or just an off day, this resource can be referenced to help get you through it! This list is by no means exhaustive and I encourage contributions from all members of the community.
